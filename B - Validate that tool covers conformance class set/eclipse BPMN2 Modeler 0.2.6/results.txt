ROUNDTRIP
General Issues: dc:Font attributes left out partly, rounding of DI values
Other deviations: Ids introduced for some elements such as bpmndi:BPMNLabel, bpmndi:BPMNPlane; attributes left out if they have the default value defined in the XSDs

B.1.0 - ISSUES (DataStore attribute capacity is missing, Attribute isMarkerVisible of BPMNShape left out, BPMNShape attribute isExpanded for Sub-Process changed to 
		expanded (see Import Issue for A.3.0))
B.2.0 - ISSUES (DataStore attribute capacity is missing, Attribute isMarkerVisible of BPMNShape left out, BPMNShape attribute isExpanded for Sub-Process changed to 
		expanded (see Import Issue for A.3.0), Attribute messageVisibleKind is missing)
