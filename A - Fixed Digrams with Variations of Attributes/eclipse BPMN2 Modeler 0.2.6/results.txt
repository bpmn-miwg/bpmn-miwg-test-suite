EXPORT
A.1.0 - OK
A.2.0 - OK
A.3.0 - ISSUES (labels for boundary events not displayed, eclipse is not able to save status (collapsed/uncollapsed) of sub-processes)
A.4.0 - ISSUES (Modeling of two processes with message flows is by default only possible when two participants are defined, which have to be visualized with two corresponding pools. 
				It is possible to recreate the model A.4.0 to some degree, but eclipse blocks the creation of a MessageFlow from Task 5 to Task 2 (only SequenceFlows are allowed). 
				However using two pools (see A.4.0-export-2pools.bpmn) it is possible to model A.4.0 without issues.)
				
ROUNDTRIP
General Issues: dc:Font attributes left out partly, rounding of DI values
Other deviations: Ids introduced for some elements such as bpmndi:BPMNLabel, bpmndi:BPMNPlane; attributes left out if they have the default value defined in the XSDs

A.1.0 - ISSUES (see general issues)
A.2.0 - ISSUES (Attribute isMarkerVisible of BPMN shape left out)
A.3.0 - ISSUES (BPMNShape attribute isExpanded for Sub-Process changed to expanded (see Import Issue for A.3.0))
A.4.0 - ISSUES (see general issues)
